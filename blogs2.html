            <p class="blog-p">Now, are you ready to dive in? Here’s an in-depth look at a few identity theft truths:
            </p> -->


            <h1 class="blog-p" style="font-size: xx-large;">Here Are 5 Ways to Stay Happy in Spirit Forever</h1>

            <h2 class="blog-p">1. Be kind to everybody, everyday</h2>
            <p class="blog-p">A meaningful life is made up of daily acts of kindness, good deeds, selfless serving and decency. Do good acts daily, be kind to everyone even if that person is a stranger. Show a little more courtesy and humanity to everyone. Try to make people smile, if you make one sad person happy during your day, your day has been a worthwhile one. Being kind to everyone gives you inner happiness. It will remove toxic and negative thoughts from your mind, expand your positive thought process, purify your aura and make you your humble version.</p>
            <h2 class="blog-p">2. Be honest to yourself and others</h2>

                <p class="blog-p">In oldest times words mattered the most. Promises were greater values than one’s own life. But now we live in a world of broken promises where people treat their words lightly. We promise our family to go on an outing on weekend with them but we do not have to do so. When we repeatedly say such things which we don’t really mean then it becomes our habit. When we don’t keep our words, we lose credibility and losing credibility breaks the bonds of trust. And it ultimately leads to a string of broken relationships.</p>
            

            <p class="blog-p">Becoming a honest person first you examine yourself that how many small untruths you tell over the course of a week. Its better to make less truthful promises rather than making more untruthful promises. If you promise someone to do something, do it. You should be a person of your words. As Mother Teresa said, “ there should be less talk; a preaching point is not a meeting point. What do you do then? Take a broom and clean someone’s house. That says enough.” </p>

            <!-- <p class="blog-p">This can leave you vulnerable to financial identity theft. If they have the right
                information, they could take over your bank account and steal your money before your able to freeze your
                account. </p>

            <p class="blog-p">It’s important you use caution when utilizing public WiFi. Only go on sites that don’t use
                passwords that are linked to your bank account, personal email, or other crucial sites.</p> -->

            <h2 class="blog-p">3. Respect your past</h2>
            <p class="blog-p">You keep thinking about your problems all the time instead of thinking about their solutions. You spend most of your time in thinking about your past and think about all those things you wish never happened to you. This actually blocking the things that you want to happen from entering into your life. Worrying about past events and feeling bad for mistakes is really not making any sense.</p>

            <p class="blog-p">When all the time you feel bad about your past and feels regret, it always pinches you somewhere inside your heart, so its better to learn let go and respect your past events. When you respect your past incidents and accept them in a way they happened then you feel free from their regrets. Because life is unpredictable and things are not always done as you wish. A person learns more from his failures and success is not measured by the position that one has reached in life, it is measured by the obstacles he has overcome while trying.</p>
<!-- 
            <p class="blog-p">Identity thieves love passwords because they open doors to our personal information. Get
                tough and organized now. Use different passwords for all your accounts. Make those passwords strong with
                at least eight characters, including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols ($+r0^gh@h@). Hide them
                safely, and keep them handy. Good password practices are work, but fixing an identity theft problem is
                hard labor!</p> -->

            <h2 class="blog-p">4. Do introspection</h2>
            <p class="blog-p">Doing introspection is also the one way of motivating yourself. Introspection is the best way of knowing your potential and your talents.</p>
            <p class="blog-p">Give time to yourself, talk to yourself it will help you to get the answers of your problems. In ancient times many people found their meaning of life, solutions of their problems by doing introspection.</p>
            <p class="blog-p">By talking to yourself you come to know more about your inner and outer self and it helps you to be more cleared about your thoughts. </p>
            <h2 class="blog-p">5. See your sufferings as blessings</h2>
            <p class="blog-p">Sufferings and blessings, they both are the uninvited guests of your life. When blessings come into your life you feel blessed, fortunate and joyful. But when sufferings come you feel unfortunate and unlucky.</p>
            <p class="blog-p">You cannot learn how to play football without hitting a few wrong kicks. Begin to see your sufferings as blessings because your character is not shaped by life’s easiest experiences, it is always shaped by life’s hardest experiences and life’s failures.</p>
            <p class="blog-p">Have patience for those things that remains unsolved in your heart. Be grateful for your sufferings because they are the one who actually shape your life, teaches you life’s most important lessons and strengthen your personality.</p>
